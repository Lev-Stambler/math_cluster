      "{'rounds': [[['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The primary theorems in this set focus on various topics such as set operations, list manipulation, properties of numbers, and algebraic structures. Some of the primary theorems discuss specific properties of sets, such as the commutativity of pairs, the equivalence between membership in a set and an option type, and the intersection of sets. Others focus on list operations, such as reversing a list, rotating a list, and mapping functions over lists. There are also primary theorems related to properties of numbers, such as divisibility, counting occurrences of elements, and the relationship between prime numbers and powers. Lastly, there are primary theorems related to algebraic structures, such as properties of ring homomorphisms and applicative transformations. \\n\\nIn contrast, the non-primary theorems in this set are a mix of lemmas and theorems that cover a wide range of topics. These non-primary theorems include properties of the modulo operation on integers and natural numbers, properties of the division operation, properties of set operations, properties of algebraic structures, and properties of list manipulation operations. Some of these theorems provide specific definitions and properties for certain operations, such as the definition of the \"pure\" function in sets or the definition of the \"to_buffer\" function on lists.
