They examine properties and behaviors when considering bounded and unbounded intervals (Iic, Ioc, Ioi, Iio), closures, set intersections, unions and complement, concepts of surjectivity and monotonicity as well as projection and preimage relationships.

They extend on the primary theorems to examine more complex applications and numerical relationships within a given field, such as number theory, abstract algebra, or analysis.\", '', 'The main focus of the primary theorems provided is largely on mathematical properties and characteristics relating to real numbers, injective functions, ordered sets (like in mathematics and computation), topology, relations, and other such mathematical constructs or operations.\\n\\nBy examining the theorems, we can see that they discuss topics such as: the injectiveness of a function, the non-zero property of prime numbers, consequences of non-existing lower bounds, non-injectiveness of a given function, properties of image multiplication, properties of singletons and operations, connectedness of a set given a certain property, properties of a greatest lower bound, the universality of a given set, properties of dual and inverse operations, normalizations, and various other mathematical ideas or constructs.\\n\\nIn comparison, the non-primary theorems given are also mathematical but focus on different constructs and operations. They involve concepts such as: properties of zero, theories of divisibility, properties of lists and sets, properties of multiplication and division, posits, operations on intervals, functions, properties of real numbers, mathematical inequalities, theories of elements in a set, binary operations, divisibility, properties of inverses, and variety of other mathematical ideas or constructs.\\n\\nOverall, the difference seems to be that the primary theorems focus more on injectiveness, order properties, topological concepts, and other such ideas, while the non-primary theorems explore a wider variety of mathematical constructs and operations. The non-primary theorems seem to contain some more complex or specialized mathematical theories compared to the primary theorems, although both sets still contain a vast array of mathematical ideas.', '', '', '', ''], ['', '', '', '', 'The primary theorems principally revolve around understanding the properties and characteristics of bitwise operations. They include theorems that explain the representation, casting, comparison, and composition of bit1 and bit0, which are unary and binary bitwise operations, respectively. Operations with positive, negative, and complex numbers are part of these theorems. Furthermore, these theorems contain standalone bitwise operations and are not dependent on a broader logical structure.\\n\\nIn contrast, the non-primary theorems primarily deal with set theory operations and the logic pertaining to unions, intersections, complements, and sup (the supremum operation). These theorems deal with the arrangement, comparison, and interactions of various sets, including their product and disjointness. They delve into the territory of propositional calculus and are interdependent theorems that contribute to building a complete understanding of set theory logic.\\n\\nThe primary difference between the two lies in the operative scope; while primary theorems explore bitwise operations, non-primary theorems delve into set theory and logic. Consequently, the application area and consequent interpretations of these theorems also differ accordingly.', '', '', 'The primary theorems in the given set seem to mainly focus on the properties of the binary number representation system, specifically the interpretations and manipulations of the Bit1 and Bit0 functions, as well as functions that are strongly connected with the binary number system such as zpow and min_fac. These theorems cover a variety of topics such as algebraic properties, order relations, and transformations under specific operations.\\n\\nThe non-primary theorems, on the other hand, are clearly fundamentally concerned with various properties of the set operations of union, intersection, set difference, etc., specifically special cases involving the empty set or general cases that can involve the empty set. They cover topics like closure under certain operations, injectivity under certain transformations, empty set relations, and set algebra among others. \\n\\nSo, the main distinction between the primary and the non-primary theorems in this specific scenario is the main concept they revolve around, with the primary theorems focusing on properties of binary number representation system and the non-primary ones focusing on operations and relations involving sets.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'The primary theorems are predominantly concerned with numerical operations and properties, particularly those related to bit-wise operations, such as bit0 and bit1, as well as related arithmetic properties, including cast functions, val functions, their relations to other numeric properties, and so on. The theorems refer to concepts in number theory and numerical algorithms, and use concepts from semirings, Ring theory, and other related mathematical structures. \\n\\nThe non-primary theorems, by contrast, do not focus exclusively on numerical properties. They instead focus on operations on sets, such as unions, intersections, complements, and various kinds of calculations and operations involving sets. Their context pertains to theories of set, order theory, topologies, and abstract algebra structures amongst others. \\n\\nThus, the difference in focus is between numerical properties and operations (primary theorems), and properties and operations involving sets and more general mathematical structures (non-primary theorems).', '', '', ''], ['', '', '', 'The primary theorems provided in this example do not carry a common focus. Instead, they range across the mathematical domains such as algebra, set theory, sequences, calculi, list theory, etc. These theorems touch upon concepts like inversion of units, epimorphisms, bag operations, pairs, sequences and transformations, among many others. Each of these theorems provides a fundamental rule within its respective domain, serving as a baseline for the development of more complex ideas. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the non-primary theorems primarily revolve around natural numbers, logic, and operations applied on them such as addition, subtraction, division, modulus, inequalities, zero properties, and also involve vector computations, tropical semirings, metrics, arrays etc. These non-primary theorems generally serve to provide mathematical rules and outcomes for specific situations, following the ground rules established by the primary theorems. \\n\\nIn other words, the provided primary theorems tend to lay down the foundations of numerous mathematical fields, while the non-primary theorems build on these foundations in order to offer logical outcomes for a variety of specific mathematical computations and conditions.', '', \"The primary theorems seem more deeply rooted in algebra and mathematical logic, focusing largely on associative equations, bijective and injective functions, properties of prime and natural numbers, and continuous functions. They often deal with the fundamental aspects of mathematics, such as set equality, the existence of certain elements, or the properties of specific mathematical operations.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the non-primary theorems appear to be more concerned with more specific mathematical operations and instances. They tend to explore relationships between different mathematical constructs or create nuance in the understanding of mathematical concepts. This can include investigating the effects of different mathematical operations, extending standard mathematical ideas in new ways, or exploring unusual mathematical circumstances. \\n\\nIt's worth noting that the primary and non-primary theorems in this context are mathematically interconnected, but the description provided does not explicitly make such references, and hence each set of theorems can be viewed in isolation. Additionally, whether a theorem is considered primary or non-primary largely depends on the context and the particular mathematical focus in which it is being considered.\", '', '', '', '', '', 'The primary theorems focus more on properties related to mathematical structures and their relations or transformations. These include concepts such as injectivity, mono f, a mono in the category theory context, binary relations with properties like symmetry, homeomorphisms between categories, etc. These theorems often discuss operations in terms of properties/structures rather than explicit operations.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the non-primary theorems are more operation-oriented and often specific. They cover a variety of mathematical fields such as order theory, integer arithmetic, set theory, etc. Their focus is more on the operations themselves, such as addition, division, modulus, etc. They also seem to provide properties, laws, and formulas for these operations. They are more direct and specific compared to the primary theorems.\\n\\nIn short, while the primary theorems deal with more abstract, conceptual structures and their properties in various mathematical fields, the non-primary theorems appear to be more operation-focused, providing propositions that deal directly with computations, specific formulas, or number properties.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']]]}\n",
