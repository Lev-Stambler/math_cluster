These theorems may be building blocks or auxiliary results that support the primary theorems or have more specific applications within their respective branches of mathematics.\\n\\nThe primary theorems appear to have a narrower focus, concentrating on specific concepts or structures within mathematics. For example, in the first set of non-primary theorems, the primary theorems focus on properties and operations related to bit numbers, while the non-primary theorems cover a broader range of mathematical concepts such as sets, functions, natural numbers, and integers.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the second set of non-primary theorems, the primary theorems focus on properties and relationships related to the least upper bound and greatest lower bound operations in a lattice structure. In contrast, the non-primary theorems cover topics such as set theory, divisibility, maps, gcd, natural numbers, integers, and multisets.\\n\\nIn the third set of non-primary theorems, the primary theorems center on properties and operations related to algebraic structures like rings, groups, and monoids. On the other hand, the non-primary theorems cover a wider range of topics such as order relations, subsets, lattice operations, injections, surjections, and various other concepts.\\n\\nIn the fourth set of non-primary theorems, the primary theorems focus on the properties and operations of specific mathematical objects like permutations, lists, vectors, and arrays. Meanwhile, the non-primary theorems center on general properties and operations of numbers and sets.\\n\\nOverall, the primary theorems in each set have a more specific and focused nature compared to the non-primary theorems, which cover a wider range of mathematical concepts and topics.',\n",

       "    'The main focus of the primary theorems is to establish foundational and fundamental results in various mathematical areas such as set theory, algebra, analysis, number theory, and logic. These theorems cover a wide range of topics and involve operations like addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Some examples of the primary theorems include properties of sets, properties of functions, properties of arithmetic operations, properties of inequalities, and properties of number systems. They provide general and widely applicable results that serve as the basis for more specialized theorems.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the non-primary theorems cover a wider range of topics compared to the primary theorems. They include results and lemmas related to specific mathematical objects such as rational numbers, Cauchy sequences, primes, integers, sets, and lists. These theorems are more specific and specialized in nature, and they may rely on or be related to the primary theorems, but they have a different main focus. They provide specific insights and results in their respective areas, supporting the proofs and arguments presented in the primary theorems.\\n\\nIn summary, the primary theorems focus on foundational mathematical concepts and operations, while the non-primary theorems provide specific and detailed results that are used in conjunction with the primary theorems.',\n",
